    <h1>Current Trend In Deep Learning</h1>

    <p><i>Co-written by: <a style="color:green">Folkestad, Manu gopinathan & Oyvind Nygard</a></i></p>

    <p>In the last decade, the area of artifial intelligence (AI) has exploded widt
      interesting and promising results. With major achievements in image
      recognition, speech recognition and highly complex games, Ai continues to
      disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical application of AI,
      optimization and interpretability of deep learning models and
      reinforcement learning (RL), based on the <u>2018 REWORK Deep Learning
      Summit</u> in Toronto. Four software engineers from <u>Knowit</u> had the pleasure
      of travelling tocanada to attend this conference, andwith renowned
      speakers such as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an insightful
      experience.

    <p><h2>Practical Prediction and Applications of AI</h2></p>

    <p>Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting. Today, the
      addiction of learning is also in place, but due to the non-deterministic nature
      of the real world, decisions cannot be made purely from the facts that are
      given. Further development of AI will require improvements in a variety of
      areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of the School of computer Science at
      Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts on what he thinks will be important.

      Firstly, game theory provides an improvement to the decision making
      capabilities of an AI model, as the most probable answer is not always the
      correct answer. This can be explained from his example of an AI trying to
      predict the whereabouts of poachers in a national park. At first, the AI
      perfomed well at predicting the location of poachers, however, after a while
      the poachers in the national park learned from this performance. To improve
      the AI, game theory was introduced. By viewing the poachers as other
      players in a game, the AI was able to predict where the poachers were
      located even though they were notnecessarily located at the optimal
      locations.

      Secondly, autonomous AI is much researched hese days. This enabled, e.g.,
      smaller robots to work together to solve a larger problem, in addition self.
      optimizing code, which means that the efficiency of an algorithm written by
      a human can be improved by an AI. These are only a few of the possibilities
      with more autonomous AI.

      As <u>presented</u> by Tzvi Aviv, Founder & CEO at AgriLogicAI, AI can lead to
      major improvements in the agriculture and food sector. In his presentation
      he showed that AI can be used in conjuction with geospatial data to
      increase productivity, profitability and sustainability in the agriculture and
      food sector. By using remote sensing yield performance of of soy varieties, soil
      data, weater data and genetic data of soy varieties, AgriLogicAI created an
      Ensemble of Cubist model, <u>a type of rule-based model</u>, model which
      prejected a 5% increase in soy yields by optimizing the selected soy variety
      given an area. This and other innovations to the agricultural food industry
      will become more and more important as we are facing a difficult time
      ahead with more challenging weather conditions.
